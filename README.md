| **Disclaimer**    |
|:------------------------------------------------------:|
| This project merely serves as a hobby. I'm still working on it. I'm merely playing around with a few technologies to try to offer myself a solution to analyze all the equities I have with all ot the fancy math I've collected over the years. I am a big fan of open source and if you believe you want to help in some sense, please feel free to reach out to me by raising an Issue in this Repo |

The goal of this project is to manage my equities. No, I don't mean manage like buying and selling, I mean managing like analyzing it. I want to apply interesting techniques to it like calculating alpha, using a unit trust method on the portfolio, make cool graphs, etc.

Basically, I want to analyze some data!

I want to build the necessary infrastructure to make it as **EASY** as possible. Ah! That will be the name! **eZe** Equity Analytics!
